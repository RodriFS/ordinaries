# Ordinary format


The basic ordinary format consists only of two keys:
```
{
  "kind": integer,
  "metadata": {
    [key]: [value]
  }
}
```

The `Kind` refers to the diffent use cases for the Ordinary format
The `Metadata` refers to anything else you want to inscribe, that's relevant to each specific format
