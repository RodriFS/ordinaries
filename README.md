# Ordinary format


The basic ordinary format consists only of two keys:
```
{
  "ois_id": integer,
  "extend": ["<previous ordinal id>"], // Optional, extend a playlist
}
```

The `ois_id` refers to the diffent use cases for the Ordinary format
The `extend` refers to listing previous inscription in order to extend them
